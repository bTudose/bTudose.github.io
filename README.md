## Simulating spreading of Coronavirus in a town with Python

This post attepmts to model the spreading of novel SARS-CoV-2 into a small Romanian town (Slatina, Olt County) by appling diffrent [Comportamental model in epidemiology.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology)

Due to [small world network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network) effect, where a signfiant part of network elements are neighbors of one another, spreading of a disease can happen faster in small to medium communites. This post is entirely based on [network-based diffusion analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-based_diffusion_analysis) which is a quintifier for transmision / diffusion of a behaviour into a social network.  

The analysis was made using Python and open source libaries (detailed below)

### !!Disclaimer!! This is not a medical article. Analysis is made entirely using statisticall modelling and may not reflect the truly evolution of the disease

# Fetching the network

In order to obatain the network topology I used [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=7/45.996/24.981) together with opensource library [osmnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx).
